## General Information
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

Business Goal is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.

## Conclusions
following features have the biggest impact on the rental:
Weather:
Feeling temperature (1 unit increase of atemp increases the rentyl by 0.447 units )
Heavy rain / or snow conditions (heavy condition decreases the rental by 0.249 units)
Windspeed
Humidity
Year
as the company is growing, the year allone explains 0.2321 unit increase in bike rentals
